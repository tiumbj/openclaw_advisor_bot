# regime-classification

## Procedure
1. Receive ATR, ADX, and range_pct from Python evidence packet
2. Apply classification rules:
   - ADX > 25 and directional DI aligned → TRENDING
   - ADX < 20 and range_pct < 0.5% on H1 → RANGING
   - ATR spike > 2× 20-day ATR → VOLATILE
   - Price close outside H4 range with volume expansion → BREAKOUT
3. Attach regime_label, regime_confidence, and supporting numerics to evidence

## Decision Tree
- ADX and ATR present → classify regime
- Only ATR available → classify VOLATILE vs non-volatile only
- No indicator data → REGIME_UNKNOWN (proceed but disable strategy-specific scoring)

## Quality Gates
- ATR and ADX must come from Python MT5 adapter with timeframe declared
- Agent cannot compute ATR/ADX from raw OHLC in its reasoning

## Failure Modes
- MT5 indicator history too short (<14 periods) → REGIME_UNKNOWN
- Transition period (regime just changed): confidence=LOW, attach transition flag
